# 42028 Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks Autumn 2020 <br />
## Assignment 1

## About the Program

Program is written as google colab notebook.<br />

Program consists of three sections, including 'Dataset Import', 'Feature Extraction' and 'Classifiers', and should be run in such order consecutively.<br />

Keras is used for the implementation of artificial neural network.<br />
Versions used:<br />
Tensorflow: 2.2.0-rc3<br />
Keras: 2.3.0-tf


### Running the program

Data used in the program are stored in google drive with the path:<br /> '/content/gdrive/My Drive/42028-DL-CNN-2020/Assignment1/Data'.<br />
Within 'Data' folder includes four ubyte.gz documents corresponds to training data, training label, testing data and testing label.<br /><br /> When testing, change the path of dataset in the function 'load_mnist' in 'Dataset Import' section accordingly if required.
